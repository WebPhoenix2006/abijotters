## My Experience
I wanted to challenge myself and try building something more advanced, so I decided to take on the task of building a full ecommerce website. It was a challenging project, but I enjoyed the process of learning and developing my skills as a web developer. The end result was a fully functional ecommerce site that was able to sell products and process transactions online. It was a rewarding experience and I am proud of the end result.

## About the project
    This project connects to a mock products API that I have built to retrieve a list of products. The user can browse through the various products and add them to their cart. The cart has a functional feature where users can add or delete items from their cart. The cart items are saved in the local storage so that they remain even after the user closes the browser.

    To improve performance, the project implements lazy loading for certain components. This means that certain components will only be loaded when needed, rather than all at once.

    The header style is also changed based on the current URL route. This allows for a better user experience as the header adjusts to the current page the user is on.

    The products are also sorted by category to make it easier for users to find what they are looking for.

    Overall, this project was a challenge to build as it required the integration of various features and technologies.
